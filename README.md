## scan community team process
```bash
1. The repository administrator creates a feature branch (accessed based on the develop branch), feature-xxx, for the community development team.
2. The community development team forks (feature-xxx) to its own repository after the self-test on development is completed.
3. The community development team submits pr to the official feature-xxx (merge the modification of the official develop branch before submission)
4. Repository administrator merges feature-xxx into one of the proposed branch, e.g. feature-turn-1.1.5
5. Testers verify the functions of the proposed branch feature-turn-1.1.5. Issue the problem if any 
6. After the test is completed, merge it into the develop branch
